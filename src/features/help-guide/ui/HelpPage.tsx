          GameOrWait is your personal game purchasing assistant. It uses AI to analyze whether a
          game is a good fit <strong>for you specifically</strong> — based on your gaming taste,
          play history, and preferences — rather than giving a generic review score.
        </P>
        <P>Here&apos;s how it works at a high level:</P>
        <OL>
          <li>
            You tell GameOrWait what you like — play style, difficulty preference, dealbreakers, and
            what matters most to you in a game (story, combat, exploration, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
            You build a <strong>game library</strong> of titles you&apos;ve played and score them.
            This becomes the AI&apos;s reference point for your taste.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you&apos;re considering buying a game, enter its name and price. The AI searches
            the web for reviews, compares them against your personal taste profile and library, and
            gives you a personalized enjoyment prediction with a target price.

          Every new account comes with <strong>5 starter analyses</strong> using our API key, so you

            Complete the rest of setup — set your taste preferences and import your game library as
            normal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Go to the Analyze page and run your first analysis. You&apos;ll see a badge showing how
            many starter analyses you have remaining.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each analysis uses one of your 5 starter slots. Starter analyses use the same AI model
            (Claude) and web search as BYOK analyses — there&apos;s no quality difference.
          </li>
        </OL>

        <SubHeading>What happens after 5 analyses?</SubHeading>
        <P>
          Once you&apos;ve used all 5 starter analyses, you&apos;ll see a message on the Analyze
          page with step-by-step instructions for adding your own API key. You can also add a key at
          any time from <strong>Settings &rarr; AI Provider</strong>.
        </P>
        <P>
          Adding your own API key unlocks <strong>unlimited analyses</strong> with no restrictions.
          You can choose any supported provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, or a custom endpoint)
          and any model. Most providers offer free starter credits, so you can keep going without
          paying anything.
        </P>

        <Callout $variant="tip">
          <strong>Starter analyses are identical to regular ones.</strong> They use Claude with web

        <SubHeading>Can I get more starter analyses?</SubHeading>
        <P>
          The 5 starter analyses are a one-time allowance per account. They cannot be reset or
          replenished. However, setting up your own API key is quick (about 2 minutes) and each
          analysis costs only a few cents.

          GameOrWait doesn&apos;t have its own AI — instead, it connects to an AI provider of your
          choice (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, or a custom endpoint). To do this, you need an{" "}
          <strong>API key</strong>.
        </P>

        <SubHeading>What is an API key?</SubHeading>
        <P>
          An API key is like a password that lets GameOrWait talk to the AI service on your behalf.
          You get it from the AI provider&apos;s website and paste it into GameOrWait during setup.
          Each analysis uses a tiny amount of the provider&apos;s credit (usually fractions of a
          cent).
        </P>

        <SubHeading>How to get one</SubHeading>
        <OL>
          <li>
            <strong>Anthropic (Claude):</strong> Go to <code>console.anthropic.com</code>, create an
            account, navigate to API Keys, and create a new key. You&apos;ll get some free credits
            to start.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>OpenAI (GPT):</strong> Go to <code>platform.openai.com</code>, sign up, go to

        <SubHeading>How much does it cost?</SubHeading>
        <P>
          A single game analysis typically costs between $0.01 and $0.05 depending on the model.
          Most providers offer free starter credits. A &quot;More Details&quot; expansion adds
          roughly the same cost again.

        <SectionAnchor id="library">Your game library</SectionAnchor>
        <P>
          Your game library is the foundation of accurate analyses. It tells the AI what kinds of
          games you enjoy (and how much), so it can predict whether a new game will suit you.
        </P>

        <SubHeading>Why it matters</SubHeading>
        <P>
          When you run an analysis, <strong>only games that have a score</strong> are sent to the AI
          as reference points. If your library is empty or no games are scored, the AI has no
          personal context and will give generic recommendations — it won&apos;t know that you loved
          Hollow Knight but hated Fortnite.
        </P>

        <Callout $variant="warning">
          <strong>Imported but unscored games are invisible to the AI.</strong> After importing your
          library, make sure to score your games. Even a rough score is far better than no score at
          all.
        </Callout>

        <SubHeading>How many games should I score?</SubHeading>
        <P>
          Aim for at least <strong>10–15 scored games</strong> across a range of genres. Include
          games you loved (high scores), games you thought were okay (mid scores), and games you
          disliked (low scores). This gives the AI contrast to work with.

        <SectionAnchor id="scoring">How scoring works</SectionAnchor>
        <P>
          GameOrWait uses a 0–100 scoring scale. There are two different ways to score a game,
          depending on how much you liked it:
        </P>

        <SubHeading>Games scored 76 and above — score them yourself</SubHeading>
        <P>
          If you genuinely loved a game — it left an impression, you&apos;d recommend it to others,
          or you&apos;d replay it — you should score it <strong>manually</strong> in the 76–100
          range. This is intentional:
        </P>
        <UL>
          <li>
            <strong>76+</strong> represents a personal endorsement. Only you know the difference
            between a game you loved (92) and one you merely enjoyed (78).
          </li>
          <li>
            The AI weighs high-scored games more heavily as positive taste anchors, so{" "}
            <strong>accuracy here matters the most</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Time played alone can&apos;t capture whether you truly loved a game — some short
            masterpieces deserve a 95, while some 100-hour games were just &quot;fine.&quot;
          </li>
        </UL>

        <Callout $variant="tip">
          <strong>How to compare and prioritize:</strong> Pick your all-time favorite game and give
          it 95–100. Then ask yourself for each other game: &quot;Did I enjoy this as much?&quot;
          Rank them relative to your top pick. A game you loved but not quite as much might be an
          85. One you really liked but wouldn&apos;t replay might be a 78.

        <SubHeading>Games scored 75 and below — use the Score Calculator</SubHeading>
        <P>
          For games you didn&apos;t love — ones you thought were okay, mediocre, or bad — use the{" "}
          <strong>Score Calculator</strong> (available in the sidebar and inside your library). It
          turns your playtime into a 0–75 score:
        </P>
        <UL>
          <li>Enter how long you played the game</li>
          <li>Check whether you finished it or not</li>
          <li>
            Finished games get their time doubled and can reach the maximum calculator score of 75.
            Unfinished games cap at 74.
          </li>
        </UL>
        <P>
          The idea:{" "}
          <strong>
            the more time you voluntarily put into a game, the more you probably enjoyed it
          </strong>{" "}
          — but if you didn&apos;t love it enough to score it 76+, the calculator handles the rest
          automatically.
        </P>

        <SubHeading>Why is the cutoff at 76?</SubHeading>
        <P>
          The 76 boundary separates &quot;games you should think about and rank personally&quot;
          from &quot;games where time played is a good enough proxy.&quot; It ensures the AI gets
          precise taste signals for the games that matter most to you, while still having useful
          data for everything else.

          Not right away. Every new account includes <strong>5 starter analyses</strong> using our
          key — no setup needed. After that, you&apos;ll set up your own key from Anthropic, OpenAI,

          Yes — go to <strong>Settings</strong> and update your taste preferences at any time.
          Saving regenerates the AI instructions, so future analyses will reflect your changes. Past

        </P>

        <SubHeading>Why do results differ between AI providers?</SubHeading>
        <P>
          Each AI model has different strengths. Anthropic (Claude) and OpenAI (GPT) models include
          web search for up-to-date review data. Google Gemini and custom endpoints may not have web
          search, which can affect the accuracy of public sentiment information.
        </P>

        <SubHeading>Do I need to score every game in my library?</SubHeading>
        <P>
          No, but <strong>only scored games count</strong>. Unscored games exist in your library for
          bookkeeping but the AI never sees them. Prioritize scoring games you feel strongly about —
          both loved and disliked.
