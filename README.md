## Quick Start

### Browser (Development)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Desktop (Tauri)

Requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) to be installed.

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri:dev
```

### Build

```bash
# Static web build (output in ./out)
npm run build

# Tauri desktop build
npm run tauri:build
```

## Building & Releasing the Windows App

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable)
- [Visual Studio Build Tools 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022) with the **C++ desktop development** workload

### Build

```powershell
npm install
npm run tauri:build
```

The installers will be generated at:
- `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/GameOrWait_<version>_x64-setup.exe` (recommended)
- `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi/GameOrWait_<version>_x64_en-US.msi`

### Releasing a New Version

1. Bump the version in `package.json` — the pre-commit hook automatically syncs it to `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` and `UpdateNotification.tsx`.

2. Commit and push your changes.

3. Deploy the web app:
   ```bash
   npm run cf:deploy
   ```

4. Build the Windows app:
   ```powershell
   npm run tauri:build
   ```

5. Create a GitHub release:
   ```powershell
   gh release create v<version> `
     "src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/GameOrWait_<version>_x64-setup.exe" `
     "src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi/GameOrWait_<version>_x64_en-US.msi" `
     --title "v<version> - Release title" `
     --notes "Release notes here" `
     --latest
   ```

Existing desktop app users will see an update notification on next launch linking them to the new release.

## Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

```bash
npm run build
npm run cf:deploy
```

Or connect your GitHub repo to Cloudflare Pages with build command `npm run build` and output directory `out`.
